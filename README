The toplevel makefile in this directory is used to create the upload source
for linux-ports-meta. By convention the directory name is supposed to be the
name of the package with version number attached.
In order to fullfill that convention and prevent git from being useless
(since the renaming produces big diffs), a soft-link is created before
calling dpkk-buildpackage.

The versioning scheme in debian/changelog must be k.k.k.a.m, where
k is the kernel version a is the ABI version and m is the version
of the linux-meta package.

You can create an upload set by calling:

	make source

Afterwards the temporary stuff can be removed by calling:

	make clean
